## Reference Paper
Photo-Realistic Monocular Gaze Redirection Using Generative Adversarial Networks
[[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12530)

The original paper implemented the model using TensorFlow 1.7. Since many functions are no longer supported in current versions, I decided to reimplement the gaze redirection model using PyTorch.
